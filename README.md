A unique style for map box library

Client : Aaron Walton via Upwork.

Mapbox styling of the base layer can achieved by twitching settings in the Mapbox Studio Account.
A similar tool that can achieve this is snazzy maps.
The unique advantage is overlaying the terrain layer.

Helps copy an image theme. color accuracy is wanting and choice of color schemes don't concur to desired output.
